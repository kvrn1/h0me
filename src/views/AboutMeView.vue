    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, please be welcome if you find your way on this website. The main goal of its existence is
      to keep me busy and stop wasting my time on unwise distractions (hello doomscrolling of
      death). I'm gonna post all kind of stuff related to projets I'm working on or things I want to
      share. I cannot guarantee the high frequency of these publications though.
    </p>
    <h2>Me</h2>
    <p>
      By the way my name is Louis, currently a CS student. For many years now, I've been flawlessly
      using Linux systems and developing various projects for school or learning purpose (webapps,
      android development, database exploitation, backend and REST API, frontend and UI/UX creation,
      etc.). Django and VueJS are my stacks of choice for web development. I'm also confortable with
      Java Spring or .NET framework (but I would prefer not to touch this crap or any of Microsoft's
      products again in my life). I like my coffee like I like my software: without some big corpo's
      AI shit in it (the pun is a bit strange but you get the idea).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my interest these past years: cinema, classical literature, vinyls, nerdy tech-related
      stuff, recently Formula 1 (can't escape the rabbit hole, please send help), a good walk in the
      forest from time to time.

    <h2>KVRN.zip</h2>
    <p>
      <var>KVRN</var> is just an abbreviation of my last name, nothing too mind breaking about it.
      The zip part sounds cool and the domain is cheap, so big win for me. The look and feel of my
      website is inspired by <a href="https://vinc.cc">Vinc</a>'s own website.
