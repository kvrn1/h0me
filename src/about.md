# About me

Hi, please be welcome if you find your way on this website. The main goal of its existence is to keep me busy and stop wasting my time on unwise distractions (hello doomscrolling of death). I'm gonna post all kinds of stuff related to projets I'm working on or things I want to share. I cannot guarantee the high frequency of these publications though.

## Me

By the way my name is Louis, currently a CS student. For many years now, I've been flawlessly using Linux systems and developing various projects for school or learning purpose (webapps, android development, database exploitation, backend and REST API, frontend and UI/UX creation, etc.). Django and VueJS are my stacks of choice for web development. I'm also confortable with Java Spring or .NET framework (but I would prefer not to touch this crap or any of Microsoft's products again in my life). I like my coffee like I like my software: without some big corpo's AI shit in it (the pun is a bit strange but you get the idea).

## KVRN.zip

`KVRN` is just an abbreviation of my last name, nothing very complicated here. The zip part sounds cool and the domain is cheap, so big win for me. The look and feel of my website is inspired by [Vinc](https://vinc.cc)'s own website.
