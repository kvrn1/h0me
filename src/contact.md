# Contact

## Email

I will very soon own a custom email address in an uncertain future (i.e. when I will have tamed the SMTP server).

In the meantime you can email me at the address `jbp.kvrn@gmail.com` by replacing `jbp` with `louis` (anti-bot prevention, sorry about that).

## Networks

You can also contact me using one of the following plateforms.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/kvrn1)
- [Mastodon](#) (TBA)
- [Matrix](#) (TBA)
