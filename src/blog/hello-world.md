# Hello world !

At last this blog a.k.a. personal website is up on prod server. I'm very thrilled to start feeding some content to this website.

## Stack used

As stated on this [page](/me), I am very confortable with Vue.js so I used [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev), a static site
generator for Markdown documents. That easily converts posts I write with Markdown to static HTML. It uses basic features of Vue.js
and Vite, the structure of the project if very similar to classic projects built with the stack. I also
used [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for page styling.

Code source of my website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kvrn1/h0me).

## Goals for the future

I do not have clear objectives of what to do right now, but bellow are some stuff I'd like to work on...

- A complete setup of a personal mail server
- Installation of a git server within my domain
- Some websites I have to put online
- A fullstack Android project for a personal usage
- A clean repo of my WM dotfiles for my laptop and my PC (I use i3 and Sway)
- ~~My master thesis~~

I'm gonna give further details for these projects soon I hope.
